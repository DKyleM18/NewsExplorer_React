# NewsExplorer

This is a website built with React + Vite that serves as the final project of TripleTen's Software Engineering course. It allows users to search news topics from the last week, register, login, and save news articles to their personal "Saved articles" page. (Full functionality coming at a later date)

## GitHub Pages

This website is being hosted on GitHub Pages at https://dkylem18.github.io/se_project_news

## Current State

The website is currently in a hardcoded backend state.

### Logging In

Any email in a valid format and password of more than 8 characters will log in the hardcoded user.

### Registering

Registering only serves to show the confirmation modal

### Saved Cards

All cards in the Saved articles page are hardcoded and only serve as test/formatting items

### NewsCard Buttons

No buttons serve their intended final functionality
